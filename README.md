Movies_index_2
==============

Upgraded Movies Index (https://github.com/dpoint01/Movies-Web-App) using PostgreSQL and haml files instead of erb + extra functionalities

Collaborated with John Keith.

The first version of Movies_index read in data from a csv file (from rotten tomatoes api). This second version
uses relational databases instead (PostgreSQL). I fetch data using SQL queries embedded in traditonal ruby code
and Sinatra.

I also implemented this second version using haml files instead of erb files. It took sometime to get used to
but it cuts down syntax dramatically!
